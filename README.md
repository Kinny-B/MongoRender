# MongoRender
# Code for testing Mongo DB by deploying to Render.
# Needs DB access keys.
# Used to deploy a working app,
# but cannot access a Mongo DB without proper keys.
The (alternative) MongoTest repository is an exact copy of this but with access keys so that it can be used to deploy a working app which can access a Mongo DB.
